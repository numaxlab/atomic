# Installation

First install Atomic Framework in your app with the npm package:
```
npm install @numaxlab/atomic
```

Once you have installed it you can choose two ways of using, extending and customizing Atomic Framework.

## Compiled

There is a compiled version of the framework shipped with the npm package. You can find it in
```@numaxlab/atomic/dist/css/numaxlab-atomic.css```. Just copy it to your project with your preferred asset building
tool and include it in your HTML head:
```html
<link href="/css/numaxlab-atomic.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Sass

If you want a higher customization and use the Sass source you have two options. In your project's ```custom.scss``` file
do either of these:

1. Import the whole framework

```scss

// Include any default variable overrides here (though functions won't be available)

@import "@numaxlab/atomic/src/numaxlab-atomic";

// Then add any customization or additional code here

```

2. Import only the needed parts

```scss

// 1. Import functions
@import "@numaxlab/atomic/src/utilities/functions";

// 2. Include any default variable overrides here

// 3. Initialize framework
@import "@numaxlab/atomic/src/utilities/init";

// 4. Import base styles
@import "@numaxlab/atomic/src/base/all";

// 5. Import the needed components only

// 6. Import your custom components or your project component extending the framework ones

```
